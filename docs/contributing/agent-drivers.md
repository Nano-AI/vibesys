# Agent Drivers

`AgentClient` presents one application interface over the supported drivers. It
owns session reuse, skill setup, response parsing, logging, usage records, and
lifecycle. A driver owns native executor setup, policy translation, turns,
events, and cleanup. Unsupported requirements fail before a session starts.

Omitting `driver` selects `agentshim`. Select the Omnigent driver directly:

```toml
[agent]
backend = "cli"
driver = "omnigent"
```

The `omnigent` package is a base dependency (pinned exactly in
`pyproject.toml`), so every install carries it; `uv sync` is enough.

## Mock driver

`driver = "mock"` is test infrastructure. It satisfies the same driver
contract while streaming a deterministic playbook, so tests exercise the real
`AgentClient` -> `OutputSink` -> server integration -> transport path without an agent
CLI, a model, or a network. It never writes events, state, or files itself.

```toml
[agent]
backend = "cli"
driver = "mock"
```

Two playbooks, both in `vibesys.agents.drivers.mock`:

- `ScriptedPlaybook` synthesizes a turn from configurable counts: assistant
  text chunks, thinking chunks, tool call/result pairs of a chosen payload
  size, todo snapshots, and usage updates, with optional per-event pacing.
- `ReplayPlaybook` re-emits a recorded run's `run-events.jsonl` at a
  configurable speed (`0` replays as fast as the consumer accepts events).

Structured turns are answered from `vibesys.agents.scripted_rounds`, which the
stub agent client shares, so a scripted run completes loop rounds on the happy
path. A response schema with no scripted artifact raises rather than being
faked. The mock is not offered through the client protocol: driver choice
stays an implementation detail.

## Omnigent constraints

- Only the `claude` and `codex` providers are supported. Omnigent 0.10.0 has no
  Gemini harness, and its `opencode-native` executor cannot run a headless
  VibeSys turn.
- `--docker` is rejected because the integration has no container launcher.
- Session-scoped stdio MCP servers use Omnigent's native MCP manager. VibeSys
  translates its provider-independent server declarations into Omnigent
  `MCPServerConfig` values, discovers namespaced tools before the first turn,
  and owns each session's MCP connections and subprocess cleanup.
  These generated specs declare no Omnigent guardrails; VibeSys remains the
  authority for which session-scoped servers are supplied to each role.
  Omnigent 0.10 launches stdio MCP subprocesses directly as children of the
  VibeSys process, outside the agent's OS-tool sandbox. Session MCP specs must
  therefore remain trusted framework configuration, not candidate input. With
  an explicit server `env`, the subprocess inherits the VibeSys process
  environment after Omnigent removes runner authentication secrets, then
  overlays those values. Without an explicit `env`, Omnigent delegates to the
  MCP SDK's restricted default environment.
- Extra host resource grants are rejected. The Omnigent path imports only the
  installed Rust toolchain automatically.
- Hidden project paths become explicit Omnigent masks. Read-only declarations
  are accepted only for top-level dot paths such as `.git` and `.vibesys`.
  Those paths are protected by the agent contract, not sandbox enforcement.

## Sandboxing

The agentshim driver wraps the agent in a `vs_sandbox` host sandbox. The
Omnigent driver builds an `OSEnvSpec` that grants workspace write access and
narrow read access to the active Rust toolchain. It selects bubblewrap on Linux
or Seatbelt on macOS and never permits an unconfined fallback.

VibeSys exposes only the Rust sysroot's `bin`, `lib`, and optional `libexec`
trees. Each executor gets an ephemeral writable Cargo home, removed when the
executor closes. Cargo keeps its conventional workspace `target` directory.
Declared hidden paths and `.codex-tmp` are explicitly masked. Top-level dot-path
scanning fails if it exceeds Omnigent's limit instead of silently exposing
paths.

Omnigent 0.10.0 cannot make `.git` and `.vibesys` read-only beneath a writable
workspace. Local operational state therefore lives outside the repository by
default, and the run contract protects those directories. This has not been
proven equivalent to sandbox enforcement.

Omnigent routes file and shell access through its `sys_os_*` tools. The driver
builds and dispatches those tools, currently through Omnigent's private
`_tool_executor` attribute. Codex native filesystem tools are disabled so all
file and shell operations use this sandboxed path.

The host must provide `bwrap` on Linux or `sandbox-exec` on macOS. If it is
missing, the driver raises `OmnigentDriverError` instead of running unconfined.
GitHub's Linux runners do not provide `bwrap`, so real OS-environment tests skip
there unless `VIBESYS_REQUIRE_SANDBOX_TESTS` is enabled.

Automated tests cover provider wiring, sandbox construction, tool dispatch,
event handling, and teardown. Credentialed live CLI validation is outside the
repository test suite.
